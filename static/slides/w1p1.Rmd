# Getting on the same page

---
# Introduce yourself!

* Most of us know each other, but a few do not.

* Tell us why you're taking the class 

* What's one fun thing you've done recently outside of school stuff?

# Structure of the course

* First 5 weeks - mostly iteration

  + Data types
  + Base R iterations
  + {purrr}
  + Batch processes and working with list columns
  + Parallel iterations (and a few extras)


--
* Second  5 weeks - Writing functions and shiny
  + Writing functions 1-3
  + Shiny 1-3
  + Packages (briefly)

---
# Labs
### 15%
### 3 @ 10 points each

Two labs on iteration and one on functions

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(blogdown)

labs <- tibble(
  Lab = 1:3,
  `Date Assigned` = mdy(c("4/7/21", "4/14/21", "5/10/21")),
  `Date Due` = mdy(c("4/14/21", "4/21/21", "5/17/21")),
  Topic = c("Subsetting lists and base R `for()` loops",
            "Multiple models and API calls with **{purrr}**",
            "Create and apply functions")
) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.Date), ~format(.x, "%a, %B %d")))

knitr::kable(labs)
```


---
# Midterm
### 70 points total (35%)
Two parts: 
* Small quiz on canvas to demonstrate knowledge (4/21; 10 points)
  + Identifying bugs in code
  + Multiple choice/fill-in the blank questions
  + Free response
  
* Take-home portion to demonstrate ability to write the correct code (assigned 4/21; 60 points)
  + Write loops to solve problems


---
# Take home portion

* Group project: 3-5 people

* Shared GitHub repo

* Fairly long - but the only homework assignment you have

* Divide it up to ease the workload, then just check each other's work

# What is it?
### Two basic options

--

# Data Product 
Similar to first class

* Brief research manuscript (can be APA or not, I don't really care 🤷)
* Shiny app
* Dashboard
  + Probably unlikely to work well though, unless you make it a shiny dashboard
* Blog post
* For the ambitious - a documented R package

---
# Tutorial
* Probably best done through a blog post or series of blog posts
* Approach as if you're teaching others about the content I'll ask you to cover
* BONUS: You can actually release the blog post(s) and may get some traffic 🎉👏🥳

# Make it your own


---
# What you have to have
* Everything on GitHub

* Publicly available dataset

* Team of 2-4

---
# What you have to cover
Unfortunately, this still is a class assignment. I have to be able to evaluate
that you can actually apply the content within a messy, real-world setting.


--
The grading criteria (which follow) may force you into some use cases that are 
a bit artificial. This is okay.


---
# Grading criteria

* No code is used repetitively (no more than twice) .b[10 points]


--
* More than one variant of `purrr::map` is used .b[10 points]


--
* At least one {purrr} function outside the basic `map` family (`walk_*`, 
  `reduce`, `modify_*`, etc.) .b[10 points]


--
* At least one instance of parallel iteration (e.g., `map2_*`, `pmap_*`) .b[10
points]


--
* At least one use case of `purrr::nest %>% mutate()` .b[10 points]


---
* At least two custom functions .b[20 points; 10 points each]
  + Each function must do exactly one thing
  + The functions **may** replicate the behavior of a base function - as noted 
    above this is about practicing the skills you learn in class


--
* Code is fully reproducible and housed on GitHub .b[10 points]


--
* No obvious errors in chosen output format .b[10 points]


--
* Deployed on the web and shareable through a link .b[10 points]


---
# Outline
### Due 5/1/19

Four components:
* Description of data source (must be publicly available)

* Purpose (tutorial or substantive)

* Chosen format

* Lingering questions
  + How can I help?


--
Please include all components - including the question(s) section!

---
# Draft
### Due 5/27/19, before class
* Expected to still be a work in progress

  + This means some of your code may be rough and/or incomplete. However:

* Direction should be obvious

* Most, if not all, grading elements should be present

* Provided to your peers so they can learn from you as much as you can learn 
  from their feedback

---
# Peer Review
* Exact same process we've used before

* If, during your peer review, you find grading elements not present,
definitely note them


--
### A note on last peer review

* Make sure you review the syllabus on what you should be noting

* Please take your time, try to be as thorough as possible

---
# Utilizing GitHub (required)
* You'll be assigned two groups to review (.b[10 points each])

* Fork their repo

* Embed comments, suggest changes to their code

* Submit a PR
  
  + Summarize your overall review in the PR


---
# Grading
250 points total

* 4 labs at 10 points each (40 points; 16%) 

* Midterm in-class (10 points; 4%)

* Midterm take-home (50 points; 20%)

* Final Project (150 points; 60%)

  + Proposal (10 points; 4%)

  + Draft (20 points; 8%)

  + Peer review (20 points; 8%)

  + Product (100 points; 40%)

### Basic data types

---
# Vectors
### Pop quiz
Discuss with your neighbor
* What are the four basic types of atomic vectors?

* What function creates a vector?

* .b[T]/.r[F]: A list (an R list) is not a vector.

* What is the fundamental difference between a matrix and a data frame?

* What does *coercion* mean, and when does it come into play?

---
# Vector types
### 4 basic types
Note there are two others (complex and raw), but we don't care about them (I've never even seen them used).

* Integer

* Double

* Logical

* Character


--
Integer and double vectors are both numeric.

---
# Creating vectors

Vectors are created with `c`. Below are examples of each of the four main types
of vectors.

```{r vector-types}
integer <- c(5L, 7L, 3L, 94L) # L explicitly an integer, not double
double <- c(3.27, 8.41, Inf, -Inf)
logical <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
character <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "violet", "rainbow")
```

---
# Coercion
* Vectors **must** be of the same type. 

* If you try to mix types, implicit coercion will occur

* Implicit coercion defaults to the most flexible type
  + which is... ?

--

```{r imp-coercion}
c(7L, 3.25)
c(3.24, TRUE, "April")
c(TRUE, 5)
```

---
# Explicit coercion
* You can alternatively define the coercion to occur

```{r exp-coercion}
as.integer(c(7L, 3.25))
as.logical(c(3.24, TRUE, "April"))
as.character(c(TRUE, 5)) # still maybe a bit unexpected?
```

---
# Checking types

* Use `typeof` to verify the type of vector

```{r typeof}
typeof(c(7L, 3.25))
typeof(as.integer(c(7L, 3.25)))
```

---
# Piping
* Although traditionally used within the tidyverse (not what we're doing here),
it can still be useful. The following are equivalent

```{r pipe}
library(magrittr)

typeof(as.integer(c(7L, 3.25)))

c(7L, 3.25) %>%
  as.integer() %>%
  typeof()
```

---
# Pop quiz
Without actually running the code, talk with your neighbor: Which will each of
the following coerce to?

```{r imp-coerce2-echo, eval = FALSE}
c(1.25, TRUE, 4L)
c(1L, FALSE)
c(7L, 6.23, "eight")
c(TRUE, 1L, 0L, "False")
```

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 1)`
---
# Answers

```{r imp-coerce2-eval}
typeof(c(1.25, TRUE, 4L))
typeof(c(1L, FALSE))
typeof(c(7L, 6.23, "eight"))
typeof(c(TRUE, 1L, 0L, "False"))
```

---
# Lists
* Lists are vectors, but not *atomic* vectors

* Fundamental difference - each element can be a different type

```{r list1}
list("a", 7L, 3.25, TRUE)
```

---
# Lists

.pull-left[

* Technically, each element of the list is an atomic vector

* The prior example included all *scalar* vectors

* Lists do not require all elements to be the same length

]


.pull-right[

```{r list2}
list(c("a", "b", "c"),
     rnorm(5), 
     c(7L, 2L),
     c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
```
]

---
# Summary
* Atomic vectors must all be the same type

  + implicit coercion occurs if not (and you haven't specified the coercion explicitly)

* Lists are also vectors, but not atomic vectors
  
  + Each element can be of a different type and length

  + Incredibly flexible, but often a little more difficult to get the hang of

---
# Next time
* More on data types
  + Missing values
  + Subsetting
  + Attributes
  + More on coercion (good to be fluent)
* Lists


### Any lingering questions?
