* Review take-home midterm (quickly)

* Purity (quickly)

* Function conditionals
	+ `if (condition) {}`
	+ embedding warnings, messages, and errors

* Return values

---
# Learning objectives
* Understand the concept of purity, and why it is often desirable
	+ And be able to define a side effect

* Be able to change the behavior of a function based on the input

* Be able to embed warnings/messages/errors

# Take-home midterm review

---
# Purity
A function is pure if

1. Its output depends *only* on its inputs

2. It makes no changes to the state of the world


--
Any behavior that changes the state of the world is referred to as a *side-effect*


--
Note - state of the world is not a technical term, just the way I think of it

---
# Common side effect functions
* We've talked about a few... what are they?


--
### A couple examples
* `print`
* `plot`
* `write.csv`
* `read.csv`
* `Sys.time`
* `options`
* `library`
* `install.packages`

# Conditionals

# Example 
From an old lab:

> Write a function that takes two vectors of the same length and returns
the total number of instances where the value is `NA` for both vectors. For
example, given the following two vectors

```{r vects1, eval = FALSE}
c(1, NA, NA, 3, 3, 9, NA)
c(NA, 3, NA, 4, NA, NA, NA)
```

> The function should return a value of `2`, because the vectors are both `NA` at
the third and seventh locations. Provide at least one additional test that the function works as expected.

---
# How do you *start* to solve this problem?

--

<span style = "text-decoration: line-through"> 
Start with writing a function
</span>


--
Solve it on a test case, then generalize!


--
### Use the vectors to solve!

```{r vects2}
a <- c(1, NA, NA, 3, 3, 9, NA)
b <- c(NA, 3, NA, 4, NA, NA, NA)
```

---
# One approach

```{r single-case}
is.na(a) 
is.na(b)
is.na(a) & is.na(b)
sum(is.na(a) & is.na(b))
```

---
# Generalize to function

```{r both_na-fun}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
```

--
### What happens if not same length?

---
# Test it

```{r test-both_na}
both_na(a, b)
both_na(c(a, a), c(b, b))
both_na(a, c(b, b)) # ???
```

--
### What's going on here?

---
# Recycling
* R will *recycle* vectors if they are divisible

```{r recycle1}
data.frame(nums = 1:4,
           lets = c("a", "b"))
```

--
* This will not work if they are not divisible

```{r recycle-fail, error = TRUE}
data.frame(nums = 1:3,
           lets = c("a", "b"))
```

---
# Unexpected results
* In the `both_na` function, recycling can lead to unexpected results, as we saw

* What should we do?

--
* Check that they are the same length, return an error if not

---
# Check lengths
* Stop the evaluation of a function and return an error message with `stop`,
but only if a condition has been met.


--
### Basic structure
```{r error1a, eval = FALSE}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(condition) {
		stop("message")
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
```

---
# Challenge

`r countdown::countdown(2)`

Modify the code below to check that the vectors are of the same length. Return
a *meaningful* error message if not. Test it out to make sure it works!

```{r error1b, eval = FALSE}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(condition) {
		stop("message")
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
```


---
# Attempt 1
* Did yours look something like this?

```{r error-message1, error = TRUE}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(length(x) != length(y)) {
		stop("Vectors are of different lengths")
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
both_na(a, b)
both_na(a, c(b, b))
```

---
# More meaningful error message?
### What would make it more meaningful?

--
State the lengths of each

--

```{r error-message2, error = TRUE}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(length(x) != length(y)) {
		v_lngths <- paste0("x = ", length(x), 
		                   ", y = ", length(y))
		stop("Vectors are of different lengths:", v_lngths)
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
both_na(a, c(b, b))
```

---
# Quick error messages
* For quick checks, with usually less than optimal messages, use `stopifnot`

* Often useful if the function is just for you

--
```{r z-score-stopifnot, error = TRUE}
z_score <- function(x) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
  x <- x[!is.na(x)]
  (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
}
z_score(c("a", "b", "c"))
z_score(c(100, 115, 112))
```

---
# warnings
If you want to embed a warning, just swap out `stop` for `warning`

---
# Challenge
### This is a tricky one

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 6)`

Modify your prior code to so it runs, but returns a warning, if the vectors are
recyclable, and  returns a meaningful error message if they're different lengths and *not* recylable.

Hint 1: You'll need two conditions

Hint 2: Check if a number is fractional with `%%`, which returns the remainder
in a division problem. So `8 %% 2` and `8 %% 4` both return zero (because
there is no remainder), while and `7 %% 2` returns 1 and `7 %% 4` returns 3.

---
# One approach

```{r error-warn}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(length(x) != length(y)) {
		lx <- length(x)
		ly <- length(y)
		
		v_lngths <- paste0("x = ", lx, ", y = ", ly)

		if(lx %% ly == 0 | ly %% lx == 0) {
			warning("Vectors were recycled (", v_lngths, ")")
		}
		else {
			stop("Vectors are of different lengths and are not recyclable:",
			     v_lngths)	
		}
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
```

---
# Test it

```{r test-error-warn, warning = TRUE, error = TRUE}
both_na(a, c(b, b))
both_na(a, c(b, b)[-1])
```

# Step back from the ledge

---
# How important is this?

* For most of the work you do? Not very

* Develop a package? Very!

* Develop functions that others use, even if not through a function? Sort of.

---
class: inverse-blue middle
# Return values

---
# Thinking more about return values
* By default the function will return the last thing that is evaluated

* Override this behavior with `return`

* This allows the return of your function to be conditional

* Generally the last thing evaluated should be the "default", or most common return value

---
# Pop quiz

* What will the following return?

```{r return-nothing}
add_two <- function(x) {
	result <- x + 2
}
```

--
### Answer: Nothing! Why?
```{r add_two-result}
add_two(7)
add_two(5)
```

---
# Specify the return value

The below are all equivalent, and all result in the same function behavior

.pull-left[
```{r add_two}
add_two.1 <- function(x) {
	result <- x + 2
	result
}
add_two.2 <- function(x) {
	x + 2
}
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r add_two.3}
add_two.3 <- function(x) {
	result <- x + 2
	return(result)
}
```
]

---
# When to use `return`?
Generally reserve `return` for you're returning a value prior to the full
evaluation of the function. Otherwise, use `.1` or `.2` methods from prior slide.

---
# Thinking about function names

Which of these is most intuitive?

```{r fun-names}
f <- function(x) {
	x <- sort(x)
	data.frame(value = x, 
	           p = ecdf(x)(x))
}

ptile <- function(x) {
	x <- sort(x)
	data.frame(value = x, 
	           ptile = ecdf(x)(x))
}
percentile_df <- function(x) {
	x <- sort(x)
	data.frame(value = x, 
	           percentile = ecdf(x)(x))
}
```

---
# Output
* The descriptive nature of the output can also help

* Maybe a little too tricky but...

```{r percentile_df}
percentile_df <- function(x) {
	arg <- as.list(match.call())
	x <- sort(x)
	d <- data.frame(value = x, 
	                percentile = ecdf(x)(x))
	
	names(d)[1] <- paste0(as.character(arg$x), collapse = "_")
	d
}
```

---
```{r precentile_df-example}
random_vector <- rnorm(100)
tail(percentile_df(random_vector))
head(percentile_df(rnorm(50)))
```

---
# How do we do this?

* I often debug functions and/or figure out how to do something within the function by changing the return value & re-running the function multiple times


.b[[demo]]


---
# Thinking about dependencies
* What's the purpose of the function?

	+ Just your use? Never needed again? Don't worry about it at all.

	+ Mass scale? Worry a fair bit, but make informed decisions.

* What's the likelihood of needing to reproduce the results in the future?

	+ If high, worry more.

* Consider using name spacing (`::`)
